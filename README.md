- Google Gemini API key (optional, for AI-powered rationales)

## 🔧 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd SkillSync
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   # Auth.js
   AUTH_SECRET=your-auth-secret-here
   NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000

   # Supabase
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-project-url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-supabase-service-role-key
   DATABASE_URL=your-postgresql-connection-string

   # Gemini AI (Optional)
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key-here
   ```

4. **Set up Supabase Database**
   
   - Create a new Supabase project
   - Run the database schema migration (SQL files available locally)
   - Configure Row Level Security (RLS) policies

5. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **User Registration**: Sign up with email/password
2. **Assessment**: Complete a comprehensive career assessment covering multiple personality traits
3. **Trait Calculation**: System calculates an 8-dimensional trait vector from responses
4. **Recommendation Engine**: Uses cosine similarity to match user traits with career paths
5. **AI Enhancement**: (Optional) Gemini AI generates personalized explanations
6. **Results**: View ranked career recommendations with detailed insights

## 📚 Key Concepts

### Trait Vector Matching
- Users receive an 8-dimensional trait vector from their assessment
- Each job path has a pre-defined trait vector
- Cosine similarity calculates match scores (0-1)
- Top matches are ranked and recommended

### Recommendation Generation
1. **Deterministic Mode**: Template-based rationales (default)
2. **AI Mode**: Gemini AI generates natural explanations (when `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set)

## 🔐 Security

- Row Level Security (RLS) on all Supabase tables
- Password hashing with bcryptjs
- Secure session management with NextAuth.js
- Environment variable protection

## 🚢 Deployment
